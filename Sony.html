			<h3>Introducing Masquerada on PS4</h3>
			<p>Having spent years playing <i>Dungeons and Dragons</i>, one thing always annoyed me: the power differential between spellcasters and the rest of the classes. As a DM, I 
			had to figure out a way to have magic prominent without having my fighters and rogues stacking dice in the corner as a group of my goblins were being blown up by another fireball.
			So, I took away the wizards and made magic something attainable by anyone who could get their hands on a mask. Players immediately began seeking out masks that enhanced their 
			class abilities. Combat became a dance of steel and spells. And that, in turn, became the basis of what would become <i>Masquerada</i>.</p>
