		<h2>Star Wars Battlefront Hit by Invincibility Bug</h2>
		<p>Several videos have emerged of invincible players in <i>Star Wars Battlefront</i>. No matter how much blaster fire they sustain, they simply won't die. Curious! 
		It could be cheaters. They love online shooters. Or it could be a bug caused by some unknown circumstances. Or it could be that they've become one with the 
		Force.Some people seem to think the bug is triggered if you crash an aircraft (like an X-wing or TIE fighter) just as the server lags.</p>

		<h2>GeForce GTX 980s are Coming to Laptops!</h2>
		<p>NVIDIA showed off some laptops with desktop caliber <i>GeForce GTX 980</i> graphics cards and the perf. was impressive. You no longer need a huge, water-cooled rig to play
		 the latest blockbuster shooters, with plenty of gaming laptops doing a fine job of marrying performance with portability. But a divide still exists, with even the best mobile 
		 GPUs defined as "desktop-class," which is a nice way of saying they aren't quite as powerful as the cards made for home office-hogging towers. That said, in what NVIDIA claims
		 is an industry first, the company has today announced its top-end <i>GeForce GTX 980</i> desktop GPU is headed to laptops. Not to be confused with the GTX 980M -- NVIDIA's previous 
		 flagship GPU for notebooks -- the GTX 980 for laptops is exactly the same as the desktop version, offering identical gaming performance.</p>
