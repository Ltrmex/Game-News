			<h3>Tim Cook Says 30 Percent Of iPhone Buyers Are Switching From Android</h3>
			<p>Apple keeps breaking records with the number of <i>iPhones</i> it sells each quarter, but CEO Tim Cook isn’t worried about that growth slowing down. Why? <i>Android</i>. Cook said 
			during the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call Tuesday afternoon that 30 percent of new <i>iPhone</i> buyers in the quarter that ended in late September were switching
			 from <i>Android</i>, which is a new record. And just two days of <i>iPhone</i> 6s and 6s Plus sales were included in the company’s Q4 earnings, so that percentage of <i>Android</i> 
			 switchers may be higher in the holiday quarter that ends in late December.</p>

			<h3>Actually Apple Copied Our Phone Design, Says HTC Exec</h3>
			<p><i>HTC's new One A9 phone</i> is getting criticized for looking exactly like the most recent <i>iPhone</i> models. But <i>HTC</i> says it was <i>Apple</i> who ripped them 
			off, not the other way around.“We’re not copying. We made a unibody metal-clad phone in 2013. It’s <i>Apple</i> that copies us in terms of the antenna design on the back,” 
			said Jack Tong, president of <i>HTC</i> North Asia, during a press event at the Taiwan launch of the <i>One A9</i>.</p>

				<h3>Samsung Galaxy A7 (2016) Hits The FCC With A 3300 mAh Battery, Narrower Chassis</h3>
				<p><i>Samsung's</i> second batch of <i>A-series</i> phones may be launched very soon, if the recent barrage of leaks, tips and benchmark database slips is any indication. Most of the
				 2016 editions of the <i>Galaxy A3</i>, <i>A5</i>, <i>A7</i> and <i>A8</i> already appeared in various databases, and we even had some purported new entrants, like a 
				<i>Galaxy A9</i>, make the rumor rounds.</p>

				<h3>How To Mirror The Screen Of Your Samsung Device And Control It With PC Or Mac</h3>
				<p>This nifty functionality is brought to us by <i>Samsung's SideSync app</i>. Thanks to it, you can wirelessly share files between your phone and <i>PC</i>, mirror the screen of the
				 handset to your desktop computer, check out your notifications, and control your smartphone. We mentioned that you can do this wirelessly by having both of your devices
				 connected to one and the same <i>Wi-Fi network</i>, but you can also benefit from <i>SideSync's</i> functionality by plugging your Samsung device in your <i>PC</i>.</p>

				<h3>A Flurry Of Christmas Themes Arrives Early On The Samsung Theme Store</h3>
				<p>Samsung can take pride in the customization options it provides with its users: the <i>Theme store</i> that launched with the <i>Galaxy A</i> series and expanded to the 
				<i>S6</i>, <i>Note 5</i> and all the latest <i>Samsung</i> devices is an easy way to completely transform the looks of your device. A <i>theme</i> will change even apps that 
				traditional launchers won't be able to modify: things like the dialer, for instance (but the change is more of a skin-deep visual one, rather than a functional alteration).</p>
