			<h3>Target Says Wii U Was One Of The Top Sellers On Thanksgiving</h3>
			<p>US retailer Target has announced that it broke its online sales record on Thanksgiving. The company says this year’s sale has easily outpaced last year’s performance. 
			The three top-selling products this year were the <i>iPad</i>, the <i>Apple Watch</i> and finally the <i>Wii U</i>. Let’s hope this trend continues for other retailers. The 
			record-breaking sales online were driven by three items: the <i>Apple iPad</i>, the <i>Apple Watch</i>, and the <i>Wii U</i> gaming console, the company said.</p>

			<h3>Xbox One vs. PS4 vs. Wii U – Which Console To Choose This Year’s Holidays?</h3>
			<p>"Santa Claus is expected to arrive in one month. If you’ve been a naughty “kid”, then you won’t get any present, so you’ll need to buy your favorite gadgets with money 
			from your own pocket. If you’re a gamer and you’re planning to buy a new console, then here are three suggestions of big names: <i>Xbox One</i>, <i>Wii U</i> and <i>PS4</i>, which 
			are worth buying. Nintendo has released its console three years ago, so it’s a bit obsolete compared to the other two models, which have been upgraded regularly and received
			 new features.</p>

			<h3>Nintendo Shares A Thanksgiving Skit Starring A Very Hungry amiibo Kirby</h3>
			<p>You might want to think twice before inviting Kirby to your next Thanksgiving dinner – or even his amiibo, which is apparently also capable of consuming large amounts
			 of food in a matter of seconds. The scary thing is that Kirby doesn’t ever seem to get full, so be sure to keep an eye on your grub if he’s ever around. The pink puffball’s
			 gluttonous behavior can be observed in the mini skit shown in the above video, featuring the acting talents of senior writer for Nintendo at Golin Chad Concelmo.</p>
